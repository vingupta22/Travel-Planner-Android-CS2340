# WanderSync - Georgia Tech CS 2340 Final
A Collaborative Travel Management System

## Introduction
WanderSync simplifies creating and managing travel itineraries for solo and group travel. With real-time collaboration, intuitive features, and a user-friendly design, the app ensures seamless planning to make planning vacations seamless.

## Design & Architecture
The app follows a modular structure, using Firebase for real-time database management and user authentication. Some of the design patterns include:

## Observer Pattern: 
Used to dynamically update the UI when changes occur in the database.
## Singleton Pattern: 
Ensures a single instance of the Firebase database reference is used throughout the app.
## Strategy Pattern: 
Implements flexible layout management for the RecyclerView.
